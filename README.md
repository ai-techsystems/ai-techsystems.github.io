## [deepC](https://ai-techsystems.github.io/deepC/)
deepC Compiler and inference framework is designed to enable and perform deep learning neural networks by focussing on features of small form-factor devices like micro-controllers, eFPGAs, cpus and other embedded devices like raspberry-pi, odroid, arduino, SparkFun Edge, risc-V, mobile phones, x86 and arm laptops among others.

## [deepC-arduino](https://github.com/ai-techsystems/arduino)
an open source deep learning framework for on-device inference adapted for arduino devices. It enables low-latency inference of on-device machine learning models with a small binary size with low memory and high performance.



## [traffic Vision](https://github.com/srohit0/trafficVision)
Deep neural network detecting cars/buses in a live traffic at a phenomenal 50 frames/sec with HD resolution (1920x1080). 

## food-AI
a trained network for identifying food items in the picture and counting calories of the plate.
